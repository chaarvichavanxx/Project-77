    write about console screen and why it is used. how to open console screen and how to print anything on console
    The console screen is a helpful screen that can be used to understand where you went wrong in your code. To open console screen, you have to right click and click "Inspect." then, go to the tab that says "Console." That is the console screen for that page you are on! I sadly do not know (Or if you did teach me, I do not remember) how to print anything on console.
